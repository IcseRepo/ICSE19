# ICSE19

1. The file logi1000_Exp1_t1.json contains the results presented in our ICSE19 paper, Experiment 1. Additional tests for Experiment 1, with equivalent results can be consulted at: logi1000_Exp1_t2.json ... logi1000_Exp1_t5.json.

2. The file logi1000_Exp2_Devi_t1.json contains the results presented in Experiment 2, specifically, the behaviour shown by the system after injecting deviations on the environment and without updating the reward values R(s,a). Additional equivalent tests with similar behaviour can be consulted at: logi1000_Exp2_Devi_t2.json ... logi1000_Exp2_Devi_t10.json

3. Finally, in logi1000_Exp2DeviJug_t1.json ... logi1000_Exp2DeviJug_t10.json, can be consulted the behaviour of the system after injecting deviations on the environment and updating the reward values R(s,a) to improve the decision-making process under the new context detected.
